I am using this small Node.js program in my work uploading products on Emag.ro marketplace, a Amazon.com like website in Romania.
This is its simplest variant.

This program's job is to make a directory with the name of a EAN code, then the directory gets populated with certain product pictures.

When applied to hundreds of directories, it makes a huge difference in productivity, since i don't have to make directories, rename them and copy paste files by hand.

After the program does its job, all the prepared directories get uploaded to a website for further processing.

node_modules is missing, github says it has too many files :)
